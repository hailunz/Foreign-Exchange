Labeling_Method

To predict USD direction
time window = 1 hour
timestamp = current date and time
type = AUDUSD (this part is just for reference, can be deleted later)
maxBid = maximum bid value within the time window
minBid = minimum bid value within the time window
avgBid = average bid value within the time window
spread = average((ask-bid)/bid)
self direction = 1 if average Bid of current time window is no less than the previous one, else 0;
EURUSD direction = EURUSD’s self direction of the current time window
GBPUSD direction = GBPUSD’s self direction of the current time window

label = 1 if average Bid of next time window is no less than the current one, otherwise 0;

feature[timestamp, type, maxBid, minBid, avgBid, avgSpread, direction compare to previous time,  EURUSD direction, GBPUSD direction], label[predicted direction]

example:
20150130-21	AUD/USD	0.77861	0.77578	0.777550298322	0.000457621616109	0	0	1	0
